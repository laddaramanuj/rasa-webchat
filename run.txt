npm run build

use the npm 16 version for it

npm -v = 8.19.4
node -v = v16.20.2

after that 
rd /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build

now go to webpack.prod.js and find for   path: path.join(__dirname, '/lib'),

mostly that index.js yoou would find in lib folder after going through this
